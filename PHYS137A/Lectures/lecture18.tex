\section{Lecture 18: Calculations with Dirac Notation}

Suppose you want to find the expectation value of some operator:
\[ \langle \hat{A} \rangle_{\Psi} = \bra{\Psi} \hat{A} \ket{\Psi} \]
We know if $\ket{\Psi} = \ket{\Psi_a}$, then it's easy to act $\hat{A}$ on
$\ket{\Psi}$ with a decomposition.
\[ \ket{\Psi} = \sum_n c_n \ket{\Psi_n}, \ket{\Psi} = \sum_m c_m^* \ket{\Psi_m} \]
