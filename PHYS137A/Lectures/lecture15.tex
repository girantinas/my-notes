\section{Lecture 15: Dirac Notation, continued}

We saw last time how dirac notation of bras and kets can be useful. We saw that we can represent
the vector $\Psi_n(x)$ however we want:
\[ \Psi_n(x) \leftrightarrow \ket*{n}, \ket*{E}, \ket*{E_n}, \ket*{\Psi_n}\]

Recall that we defined operators:
\[ \hat{a}_{\pm} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \qty[\qty(\frac{m\omega}{\hbar})^{1/2} \hat{x} \mp i \frac{\hat{p}_x}{(m\hbar \omega)^{1/2}}] \]
In fact, this ladder operator can always be written with any Fourier pair of operators (instead of $\hat{x}, \hat{p}$).

We said that $\hat{H} = \hbar \omega(\hat{N} + \frac{1}{2})$.
